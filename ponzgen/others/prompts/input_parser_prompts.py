    Extract 5-6 most relevant keywords from the agent name and description below.

    ### Task ###
    Analyze the user input to determine if they are describing multiple agents and if so, extract information about each agent.
    
    ### User Input ###
    {user_input}
    
    ### Instructions ###
    1. Identify how many distinct agents are being described.
    2. Extract common attributes that apply to all agents (if any).
    3. Extract specific differences between agents.
    4. Return your analysis as a JSON object with the following structure:
    
    ```json
    {{
        "agent_count": <number of agents detected>,
        "common_attributes": {{
            "agent_name": "<common name pattern if applicable>",
            "description": "<common description if applicable>",
            "other_common_field": "<value>"
            ...
        }},
        "agent_variations": [
            {{
                "agent_name": "<name of agent 1>",
                "description": "<specific description for agent 1>",
                "specific_field_1": "<value specific to agent 1>"
            }},
            {{
                "agent_name": "<name of agent 2>",
                "description": "<specific description for agent 2>",
                "specific_field_2": "<value specific to agent 2>"

            ...
        ],
        "need_more_info": true/false,
        "missing_info": "<description of what information is missing>"
    }}
    ```
    
    5. Set need_more_info to true if you cannot determine the number of agents or clear differences between them.
    6. Be precise about differentiating factors between agents.
    7. Make sure every agent variation has at minimum these fields:
       - agent_name (a unique name for each agent)
       - description (a specific description for each agent)
    8. Don't use "agent_style" - use "agent_name" instead for naming fields consistently.
    9. All agents must have the same field structure (include the same fields even if empty).
